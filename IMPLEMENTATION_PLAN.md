# MACHETE Platform Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

**MACHETE** (Multi-purpose Automation & Configuration Hub for Engineering Tools and Execution) is a containerized platform that serves as a Swiss Army knife for engineering tools. It provides a unified interface to manage and access various automation tools through a web-based frontend.

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

### Core Components
1. **Caddy Reverse Proxy** - Routes traffic and provides HTTPS
2. **React Frontend** - Dashboard and tool management interface
3. **Python FastAPI Backend** - Core platform services and tool management
4. **PostgreSQL Database** - Tool registry and configuration storage
5. **Docker Integration** - Container management for tools

### Tool System
- Each tool runs in its own isolated Docker container
- Tools are installed from Git repositories
- Standardized configuration via `tool.json`
- Automatic container building and management
- Hot-swappable tools without platform restart

- [ ] Tool dependency management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Git
- 4GB+ RAM
- 10GB+ free disk space

### Quick Setup

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
git clone <repository-url>
cd machete
# If you get execution policy errors, run:
# Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
.\scripts\setup.ps1
```

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd machete
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Access
- **Platform Dashboard**: http://localhost:8080
- **API Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/api/health
- **Tool Registry**: http://localhost:8080/tools

## 🔧 Tool Development

### Creating a New Tool

1. **Use the Template**
   ```bash
   cp -r tools/_template tools/my-new-tool
   cd tools/my-new-tool
   ```

2. **Configure tool.json**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "my-new-tool",
     "name": "My New Tool",
     "description": "What this tool does",
     "docker": {
       "ports": ["8080:8080"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Functionality**
   - Create your application (Node.js, Python, etc.)
   - Ensure it runs on port 8080
   - Include `/health` endpoint
   - Handle graceful shutdown

4. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-tool .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 my-tool
   ```

5. **Install via MACHETE**
   - Push to Git repository
   - Use Tool Registry in MACHETE dashboard
   - Enter Git URL and credentials (if needed)

### Tool Requirements
- Must expose port 8080
- Must include `/health` endpoint for health checks
- Should handle SIGTERM for graceful shutdown
- Must include proper error handling
- Should follow REST API conventions

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Watch logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# Access development servers
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (with hot reload)
# API: http://localhost:3001 (with nodemon)
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Production build and start
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Security
- Docker container isolation
- No authentication (development mode)
- Local network access only

### Future Security Enhancements
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Tool-level permissions
- SSL/TLS termination
- Security scanning for tools

## 📊 Monitoring & Management

### Health Checks
- Platform health: `http://localhost:8080/health`
- API health: `http://localhost:8080/api/health`
- Individual tool health: `http://localhost:8080/tools/{tool-id}/health`

### Container Management
```bash
# View all containers
docker-compose ps

# Check tool containers
docker ps | grep machete-tool

# Tool logs
docker logs machete-tool-{tool-id}
```
